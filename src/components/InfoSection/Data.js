    description: 'Hello! Or for my French mates out there, bonjour! My name is Kenny Zhao and I am a Canadian University student who currently lives in Ontario. Ever since I started programming when I was a little kid, I immediately fell in love with it and continue to this day to code. I have a passion for not only computer science but also learning new things every single day. Below you can check out my top four languages!',    
    description2: 'I am a very extroverted person who absolutely loves to talk and work with others. When I am not coding, you can catch me playing video games with friends, playing music with my guitar or piano, or even at the pool swimming. I have only started my journey into computer science and I cannot wait to explore and dive deeper into a world that I am so passionate about.',
